# Elasticsearch Clients

While getting familiar with features provided by Elasticsearch, we'll typically try new things out
by making calls directly against the REST API it provides.

If you're writing an application that depends on Elasticsearch, you _could_ write it to do something
similar, making low level HTTP calls against the REST API.  The drawback to this would be the amount
of non-business focused, "plumbing" code you would need to write in support of making these calls.

Luckily, there's a wide variety of
[clients](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/community/current/clients.html)
available for connecting to Elasticsearch.  Some are provided _by_ [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) (the company behind
Elasticsearch), and some are provided by the wider, open-source community.

In this post, we'll take a look at four of the 'official' clients provided by Elastic:

* **Elasticsearch.NET**
* **NEST**
* **elasticsearch-py**
* **elasticsearch-dsl**

We'll also take a quick look at a Chrome plugin that's _extremely_ useful when making our direct
REST API calls.  It provides a simpler syntax than what's needed when making the same calls using cURL.

## .NET Clients

### Elasticsearch.NET

From the [Elasticsearch.NET & NEST Documentation](http://nest.azurewebsites.net/)

> Elasticsearch.Net is a very low level, dependency free, client that has no opinions about how you
> build and represent your requests and responses. It has abstracted enough so that all the
> Elasticsearch API endpoints are represented as methods but not too much to get in the way of how
> you want to build your json/request/response objects. It also comes with builtin,
> configurable/overridable, cluster failover retry mechanisms. Elasticsearch is elastic so why not
> your client?

### NEST

From the [Elasticsearch.NET & NEST Documentation](http://nest.azurewebsites.net/)

> NEST is a high level client that has the advantage of having mapped all the request and response
> objects, comes with a strongly typed query DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the Elasticsearch query DSL,
> and takes advantage of specific .NET features such as covariant results. NEST internally uses, and
> still exposes, the low level Elasticsearch.Net client.


## Python Clients

### elasticsearch-py

From the [elasticsearch-py Documentation](http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/master/):

> Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common ground for all
> Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries to be opinion-free and very
> extendable.

> For a more high level client library with more limited scope, have a look at elasticsearch-dsl - it
> is a more pythonic library sitting on top of elasticsearch-py.

### elasticsearch-dsl

From the [elasticsearch-dsl Documentation](http://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):

> Elasticsearch DSL is a high-level library whose aim is to help with writing and running queries
> against Elasticsearch. It is built on top of the official low-level client (elasticsearch-py).
> 
> It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate queries. It stays close to
> the Elasticsearch JSON DSL, mirroring its terminology and structure. It exposes the whole range of
> the DSL from Python either directly using defined classes or a queryset-like expressions.
> 
> It also provides an optional wrapper for working with documents as Python objects: defining
> mappings, retrieving and saving documents, wrapping the document data in user-defined classes.
> 
> To use the other Elasticsearch APIs (eg. cluster health) just use the underlying client.


(In future posts, client code examples will focus largely on NEST.  In most cases, though, links  to similar code examples for Elasticsearch.NET and elasticsearch-py will be provided.)

## Sense Plugin

To do anything useful with Elasticsearch, we'll need to give it some text to work with.  In the
**next post**, we'll start looking at **indexing**, the process of getting data _into_
Elasticsearch.
