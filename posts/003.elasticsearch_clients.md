# Elasticsearch Clients

In the [last post](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/05/20/you-know-for-search/) we got
Elasticsearch installed, and ran a simple check to ensure that everything was set up OK.  Now it's
time to take a look at some of the client libraries available for connecting to Elasticsearch.

While getting familiar with the features provided by Elasticsearch, we'll typically try new things out
by making calls directly against the REST API it provides.

If you're writing an application that depends on Elasticsearch, you _could_ write it to do something
similar, making low level HTTP calls against the REST API.  The drawback to this would be the amount
of non-business focused, "plumbing" code you would need to write in order to make these calls.

Luckily, there is a **wide variety of
[clients](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/community/current/clients.html)**
available for connecting to Elasticsearch.  Some are provided by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)
(the company behind Elasticsearch), and some are provided by the wider, open-source community.

In this post, we'll take a look at two of the 'official' clients provided by Elastic targeted at
applications built on the .NET framework:

* **Elasticsearch.NET**
* **NEST**

We'll also take a quick look at a **Chrome plugin that's _extremely_ useful** when making our direct
REST API calls.  It provides a simpler syntax than what's needed when making the same calls using
cURL, as well as other useful capabilities like code suggestions, syntax highlighting, and query
history.

## Elasticsearch.NET

From the [Elasticsearch.NET & NEST Documentation](http://nest.azurewebsites.net/)

> Elasticsearch.Net is a very low level, dependency free, client that has no opinions about how you
> build and represent your requests and responses. It has abstracted enough so that all the
> Elasticsearch API endpoints are represented as methods but not too much to get in the way of how
> you want to build your json/request/response objects.

It's easily installed via NuGet:

```
install-package Elasticsearch.NET
```

To make a connection to a single instance of Elasticsearch, we set up a `ConnectionConfiguration`
object, providing the URI of the instance, and then instantiate an `ElasticsearchClient` with the
newly created configuration:

```cs
var uri = new Uri("http://localhost:9200");
var config = new ConnectionConfiguration(uri);            
var client = new ElasticsearchClient(config);
```

Now that we have a client, we can use it to make calls against our Elasticsearch instance.  As an example,
if we want to request the same information that we would get by calling:

```
http://localhost:9200?pretty
```

We could make the following request using our client object:

```cs
var response = client.Info<string>();
Console.WriteLine(response.Response);
```

Under the covers, Elasticsearch.Net is calling the same REST endpoint behind the URL noted above.

Elasticsearch.NET also provides a
[SniffingConnectionPool](http://nest.azurewebsites.net/elasticsearch-net/cluster-failover.html) that
can be used to provide failover support when one or more nodes within a cluster are unavailable.
We'll look at that in a future post when we look at clusters, nodes, and shards.

## NEST

From the [Elasticsearch.NET & NEST Documentation](http://nest.azurewebsites.net/)

> NEST is a high level client that has the advantage of having mapped all the request and response
> objects, comes with a strongly typed query DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the Elasticsearch query DSL,
> and takes advantage of specific .NET features such as covariant results. NEST internally uses, and
> still exposes, the low level Elasticsearch.Net client.

Like Elasticsearch.Net, NEST can be installed via NuGet:

```
install-package NEST
```

Setting up a basic connection is very similar to the approach in Elasticsearch.Net:

```cs
var uri = new Uri("http://localhost:9200");
var config = new ConnectionSettings(uri);
var client = new ElasticClient(config);
```

Notice that although they appear _similar_, the configuration and client types are different in the two libraries:

* `ConnectionConfiguration` (Elasticsearch.Net) vs `ConnectionSettings` (NEST)
* `ElasticsearchClient` (Elasticsearch.Net) vs `ElasticClient` (NEST)


Requesting the information returned by the root Elasticsearch instance URL in NEST is as follows:

```cs
var response = client.RootNodeInfo();
```

Whereas the Elasticsearch.Net info call returns the actual JSON returned by Elasticsearch, the NEST
call returns a strongly typed object implementing the `IRootInfoResponse` interface:

```cs
var response = client.RootNodeInfo();
Console.WriteLine("Status: " + response.Status);
Console.WriteLine("Name: " + response.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Version Number: " + response.Version.Number);
Console.WriteLine("Version Is Snapshot Build: " + response.Version.IsSnapShotBuild);
Console.WriteLine("Lucene Version: " + response.Version.LuceneVersion);
Console.WriteLine("Tagline: " + response.Tagline);
```

One nice feature of NEST (arising from the fact that it leverages Elasticsearch.Net under the
covers) is that it exposes its underlying Elasticsearch.Net client on the NEST client interface.
This gives us the ability, if we have a NEST client, to make both high-level NEST and low-level
Elasticsearch.Net calls, as needed:

```cs
var response1 = client.RootNodeInfo(); // returns typed IRootInfoReponse
var response2 = client.Raw.Info<string>(); // returns raw JSON response
```

(In future posts, client code examples will focus largely on NEST.  In most cases, though, links to
similar code examples for Elasticsearch.NET will be provided.)

## Sense Plugin

One tool that we'll use extensively throughout upcoming posts is the
[Sense Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense-beta/lhjgkmllcaadmopgmanpapmpjgmfcfig).
If you're going to be following allowing through the code examples, I'd definitely recommend
installing it.

Once it's installed, a new icon will be displayed in the chrome toolbar:

![Sense Toolbar Icon](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/003.SensePluginToolbarIcon.png)\

Click the icon to generate a new tab showing the Sense UI:

![Sense Plugin - New Tab](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/003.SensePluginNewTab.png)\

At the top of the UI, enter the URL for the Elasticsearch instance you want to communicate with:

![Sense Plugin - Host Entry](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/003.SensePluginHostEntry.png)\

In the panel on the left, you can now enter requests against the REST API in an 'abbreviated'
format.  As an example, to request the root node info we've been looking at recently, enter the
following request:

```
GET /
```

Once you've entered the query, either press Control-Enter, or click the play button displayed to the
right of the request.  You'll see the results of the request shown to the right:

![Sense Plugin - Results](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/003.SensePluginResults.png)\


A couple of things to note:

* Because the protocol and host are specified 'globally' (in the _Server_ text box), you leave those
  values out of the request.  As a result, each request only requires the details unique to _that
  specific request_.
* The results are automatically pretty-printed, without needing to add the `pretty` query parameter
  to each request.
* The request entry pane provides code suggestion support:

![Sense Plugin - Code Suggestion](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/003.SensePluginCodeSuggestion.png)\


* Request history is captured and available for pulling up later:

![Sense Plugin - History](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/003.SensePluginHistory.png)\


Given all the great features of the Sense plugin, I've adopted it as my go-to tool for ad hoc
queries.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.


## Next Steps

To do anything useful with Elasticsearch, we'll need to give it some text to work with.  In the
**next post**, we'll start looking at **indexing**, the process of getting data _into_
Elasticsearch.
