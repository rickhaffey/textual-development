# Elasticsearch Clients

While getting familiar with features provided by Elasticsearch, we'll typically try new things out
by making calls directly against the REST API it provides.

If you're writing an application that depends on Elasticsearch, you _could_ write it to do something
similar, making low level HTTP calls against the REST API.  The drawback to this would be the amount
of non-business focused, "plumbing" code you would need to write in support of making these calls.

Luckily, there's a wide variety of
[clients](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/community/current/clients.html)
available for connecting to Elasticsearch.  Some are provided _by_ [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) (the company behind
Elasticsearch), and some are provided by the wider, open-source community.

In this post, we'll take a look at three of the 'official' clients provided by Elastic:

* **Elasticsearch.NET**
* **NEST**
* **elasticsearch-py**

We'll also take a quick look at a Chrome plugin that's _extremely_ useful when making our direct
REST API calls.  It provides a simpler syntax than what's needed when making the same calls using cURL.

## Elasticsearch.NET

## NEST

## elasticsearch-py


(In future posts, client code examples will focus largely on NEST.  In most cases, though, links  to similar code examples for Elasticsearch.NET and elasticsearch-py will be provided.)

## Sense Plugin

To do anything useful with Elasticsearch, we'll need to give it some text to work with.  In the
**next post**, we'll start looking at **indexing**, the process of getting data _into_
Elasticsearch.
