# You Know, for Search

As I mentioned
[previously](file:///C:/Users/rhaffey/Desktop/textual-development/posts/150509.intro.html), we'll
start our journey be using **Elasticsearch** (and the capabilities it provides) as a rough 'map' of the
terrain ahead.

The first question you might ask yourself is: **"What is Elasticsearch?"**  If we go straight to the 
[source](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch), we see that:

> Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine, designed for horizontal
> scalability, reliability, and easy management.

Elasticsearch provides a pretty
[**extensive set of functionality**](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) including
full-text search, real-time analytics, and a RESTful API. If we factor in what's provided by the
full ELK stack (Elasticsearch + [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) +
[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)), we find there's even more available.

Because one of the challenges in working with text is **finding the right text** to fit a given
problem, we'll spend a good amount of focus on the **full-text search** capabilities provided by
Elasticsearch.  In the process, we'll also touch on a variety of related topics, including:

* indexing,
* analysis,
* mapping,
* inverted indices,
* NoSQL storage,
* REST API,
* aggregates,
* and more

Let's get this jouney started by taking our first step...

## Elasticsearch Setup

We need to get Elasticsearch downloaded and installed -- we'll find that it's a _really_ simple
process.

(In the steps below, I show my preferred approach of performing all the setup steps via
the command line.  You could also easily peform the same steps using UI based tools.)

1. **Download** the Elasticsearch [distribution zip file](https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.5.2.zip).

You could do this manually in the browser, or using an HTTP client like [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/):

```
curl -XGET -O https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.5.2.zip
```

2. **Unzip** the downloaded file.  (I prefer using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) when working with zipped files):

```
7z x elasticsearch-1.5.2.zip
```

3. **Start up** an instance of Elasticsearch:

```
.\elasticsearch-1.5.2\bin\elasticsearch
```

That's it.

In the command prompt, you should see some log messages output by Elasticsearch related to
startup and initialization.

At this point, to confirm that we're able to **connect to Elasticsearch**, we'll use Elasticsearch's
REST API to request information about the newly running instance:

```
curl -XGET http://localhost:9200?pretty
```

If all goes well, you should see output similar to the following:

```
{
  "status" : 200,
  "name" : "Dracula",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "1.5.2",
    "build_hash" : "62ff9868b4c8a0c45860bebb259e21980778ab1c",
    "build_timestamp" : "2015-04-27T09:21:06Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "4.10.4"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

At this point, we're officially up and running, and able to connect to Elasticsearch.

Before we get deep into indexing and querying data in Elasticsearch, we'll want to get a feel for
some of the different options available for **connecting to it**.  In the **next post**, we'll look
at a few of the different Elasticsearch clients that are available, and see some code examples for
a few of them.
