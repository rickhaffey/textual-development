## Summary

We're at a point where we need to get some data _into_ Elasticsearch so we can start looking at what
it takes to get useful information back _out_.  To do this, we'll need to take two steps:

* Pick some actual _data_ that we want to work with, and 
* Learn how to **index** that data in Elasticsearch.

## Data Set

For our data, we'll be using the set of albums in
[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531)
(from May, 2012.)  This data is nice because it offers some substantial text blocks (in the album
summaries) while also providing a set of attributes (artist, title, release year, etc.) that offer
some variety for trying out various techniques.

## Indexing Overview

Indexing is the process of getting our data _into_ Elasticsearch.  (We'll talk more about _why_ it's
called indexing when we look at inverted indices in a future post.)  In addition to being a search
and analytics engine, Elasticsearch is also a NoSQL, document-oriented datastore.  We'll contrast
this with a traditional relational databse as a way of introducing the objects involved when
indexing data in Elasticsearch.

In a relational database, we typically add new data by inserting **rows** into a specific **table** within a particular **database**.

In Elasticsearh, we carry out a _similar_ operation by indexing a **document** of a given **type** into a particular **index**.  The table below shows a
side-by-side listing of the similar objects:

Elasticsearch		Relational
---------------		----------
Document			Row 
Type				Table
Index				Database
---------------		----------

Because ES is a document-oriented store, it allows us to work with our data as JSON documents.  All
the basic operations around creating, reading, updating, and documents involves .

Let's take a look how we go about getting a doc in.


## PUT document

For our example document, we're going to use album # 59 from the Rolling Stone listing:
[CCR Chronicle Vol. 1](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/creedence-clearwater-revival-chronicle-vol-1-20120524).

If we capture the data related to this album as a JSON document, it would look something like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
  "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/creedence-clearwater-revival-chronicle-vol-1-20120524",
  "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
  "rank": 59,
  "label": "Fantasy",
  "year": 1976,
  "summary": "Between 1968 and early 1972, CCR rolled out 13 Top 40 songs, which still stand as the most impressive run of hits made by an American ... ",
  "img_url": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/list/c305a673692a96976fce8b404c1bf141b7db621e.jpg"
}
```





```json
PUT /albums/album/59
{
  "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
  "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/creedence-clearwater-revival-chronicle-vol-1-20120524",
  "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
  "rank": 59,
  "label": "Fantasy",

  "summary": "Between 1968 and early 1972, CCR rolled out 13 Top 40 songs, which still stand as the most impressive run of hits made by an American ... ",
  "img_url": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/list/c305a673692a96976fce8b404c1bf141b7db621e.jpg"
}
```


## POST document



```json
POST /albums/album
{
  "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
  "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/creedence-clearwater-revival-chronicle-vol-1-20120524",
  "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
  "rank": 59,
  ...
}
```

* Not going to cover all the ins-and-outs of the REST interface right now.  See ... for more details in the short term.
* Simple searching...
