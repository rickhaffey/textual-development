## Summary

We're at a point where we need to get some data _into_ Elasticsearch so we can start looking at what
it takes to get useful information back _out_.  To do this, we'll need to take two steps:

* Pick some actual _data_ that we want to work with, and 
* Learn how to **index** that data in Elasticsearch.

## Data Set

For our data, we'll be using the set of albums in
[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531)
(from May, 2012.)  This data is nice because it offers some substantial text blocks (in the album
summaries) while also providing a set of attributes (artist, title, release year, etc.) that offer
some variety for trying out various techniques.

## Indexing Overview

ES is a _document oriented_ data store.  It lets us provide our data in JSON format, and 



> Document-Oriented
> 
> Store complex real world entities in Elasticsearch as structured JSON documents. All fields are
> indexed by default, and all the indices can be used in a single query, to easily return complex
> results at breathtaking speed.
> 
> Schema-Free
> 
> Elasticsearch allows you to get started fast. Simply index a JSON document and it will automatically
> detect the data structure and types, create an index, and make your data searchable. You also have
> full control to customize how your data is indexed.



* Document => Row
* Type => Table
* Index => Database

* ES stores data as _documents_.
* JSON is the serialization format.
