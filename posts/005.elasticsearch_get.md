In our [last post](), we learned how to put documents into
Elasticsearch.  Now we'll look at how we go about getting those
documents back out.

## Retrieving via GET

We've already looked at using HTTP POST and PUT to insert documents
into Elasticsearch.  As you might guess, in order to get these
documents back out, we'll need to use HTTP GET requests.


previously : PUT : `PUT /rolling-stone-500/album/59'

change the verb to 'GET' to retireve the same doc

We simply make a a GET request, similar to our original POST, but
including the id of the document we're requesting as the final segment
of the URL:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/album/AU23IKBIhgIsIPcT67Z8
```

Submitting the above request would return the following response:


```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "album",
   "_id": "AU23IKBIhgIsIPcT67Z8",
   "_version": 1,
   "found": true,
   "_source": {
      "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
      "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/ ... /20120524",
      "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
	  ... 
   }
}
```

Much of the response looks similar to what we saw with the original `POST`.  In addition, there's a
new `_source` field that contains the entire JSON document that we indexed originally.
