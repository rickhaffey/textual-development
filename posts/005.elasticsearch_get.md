In our
[last post](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/06/04/an-index-on-our-progress/),
we learned how to index documents in Elasticsearch.  Now we'll look at
how we go about **getting those documents back out**.

## Retrieving via HTTP GET

When we want to index a document, and we are going to provide the _id_
for the document (rather than having the server generate an id for
us), we use an
**[HTTP PUT](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6)**
request:

```json
PUT /rolling-stone-500/album/59
{
  ...
}
```

As you might guess, when we want to get the same document back out of
Elasticsearch, we instead use
**[HTTP _GET_](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.3)**.
The request for that is exactly the same as the PUT request, except:

* We change the HTTP verb to _GET_.
* There's no body included with the request.

As a result, the request would look like this:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/album/59
```

Submitting the above request returns the following response:

```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "album",
   "_id": "59",
   "_version": 1,
   "found": true,
   "_source": {
      "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
      "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/...-chronicle-vol-1-20120524",
      "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
      "rank": 59,
      "label": "Fantasy",
      "year": 1976,
      "summary": "Between 1968 and early 1972, CCR rolled out 13 Top 40 ... ",
      "imageUrl": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets ... .jpg"
   }
}
```

Much of the response looks **similar to what we saw with the original POST**.  In addition, there's

* A new _\_source_ field that contains the entire JSON document that we indexed originally.
* A _found_ field indicating whether or not the document requested was
  found.  (As expected in this case, the value is _true_.)

### 'Not Found' Responses

If we were to make a request using an **id that doesn't correspond to
an existing document**:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/album/501
```

The HTTP response code would be 404 (Not Found):

![404](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/005.404_Response.png)

And the body of the response would indicate the same (_found_ = _false_):

```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "album",
   "_id": "501",
   "found": false
}
```

Making a request against a **_type_ that doesn't exist** within a given index results in a similar response.

In contrast, making a GET request against a **_non-existent index_**
will also generate an error message in the response body:

```json
GET /foo/album/59
```

Results in:

```json
{
   "error": "IndexMissingException[[foo] missing]",
   "status": 404
}
```

## Getting Via NEST

To retrieve documents from Elasticsearch using NEST, we need to **first
define a POCO `Album` class** to hold the data returned in the response.
This is the same `Album` class we
[defined and used in the last post](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/06/04/an-index-on-our-progress/#nest)
as part of indexing.  We then need to
**[instantiate a NEST client and connect to our Elasticsearch instance](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/05/28/connecting-the-dots/#nest)**.

Once these preliminaries are taken care of, we can make a call to `Get<Album>()` to **retrieve a given document**:

```cs
IGetResponse<Album> response = client.Get<Album> (i => i
	.Index ("rolling-stone-500")
	.Id (59)
  );
```

The lambda expression passed to the `Get` function represents a
`Func<GetDescriptor<Album>, GetDescriptor<Album>>`, and is similar to
the lambda expression we used when performing the original indexing.
It provides details as to the _index_ and _id_ of our request.  (NEST
is able to infer the _type_ to use in the request, based on the name
of our class.)

The **response that we get back** is of type `IGetResponse<Album>`, and can
be inspected to get top-level response values:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("_index: {0}", response.Index);
Console.WriteLine("_type: {0}", response.Type);
Console.WriteLine("_id: {0}", response.Id);
Console.WriteLine("found: {0}", response.Found);
```

It also contains a `Source` property of type `Album` that corresponds
to the `_source` value in the HTTP GET request:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", response.Source.Title);
Console.WriteLine("Url: {0}", response.Source.Url);
Console.WriteLine("Artist: {0}", response.Source.Artist);
Console.WriteLine("Rank: {0}", response.Source.Rank);
Console.WriteLine("Label: {0}", response.Source.Label);
Console.WriteLine("Year: {0}", response.Source.Year);
Console.WriteLine("Summary: {0}", response.Source.Summary);
Console.WriteLine("ImageUrl: {0}", response.Source.ImageUrl);
```

The code above generates the following output:

```
_index: rolling-stone-500
_type: album
_id: 59
found: True

Title: Chronicle Vol. 1
Url: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/...-chronicle-vol-1-20120524
Artist: Creedence Clearwater Revival
Rank: 59
Label: Fantasy
Year: 1976
Summary: Between 1968 and early 1972, CCR ... 
ImageUrl: http://assets.rollingstone.com/....1b7db621e.jpg
```

If we were to make **a request using either an id, type, or index that
doesn't exist**, such as:

```cs
IGetResponse<Album> response = client.Get<Album> (i => i
	.Index ("rolling-stone-500")
	.Id (501)
  );
```

or

```cs
IGetResponse<Album> response = client.Get<Album> (i => i
	.Index ("foo")
	.Id (59)
  );
```

The generated response would have:

* a _found_ value of _False_, and
* a null _Source_ value.

The `IGetResponse` also includes a `ConnectionStatus` property that
implements the `Elasticsearch.Net.IElasticsearchResponse` interface.
One of the members of this interface is `HttpStatusCode`.  In cases
where the `Get` request finds a match, the value returned will be
_200_ (OK).  In the response for the two requests above, the value
would instead be _404_ (Not Found).

## Summary

As you can see, getting a document back out of Elasticsearch when we
know its id is pretty straightforward stuff.  We're almost to the
point where we can start **_searching_ for documents**, rather than just
_getting_ specific docs by id.  Before that, though, we need a way to
efficiently index a large number of documents into Elasticsearch.  In
the **next post**, we'll take a look at using the Elasticsearch Bulk API
to do just that.
