In our
[last post](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/06/04/an-index-on-our-progress/),
we learned how to put documents into Elasticsearch.  Now we'll look at
how we go about getting those documents back out.

## Retrieving via GET

When we want to index a document, and we (rather than the server) are
going to provide the _id_ for the document, we use an
[HTTP PUT](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6)
request:

```json
PUT /rolling-stone-500/album/59
{
  ...
}
```

As you might guess, when we want to get the same document back out of
Elasticsearch, we instead use
[HTTP _GET_](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.3).
The request to do that is exactly the same as the PUT request, except:

* We change the HTTP verb to _GET_.
* There's no body included with the request.

As a result, the request would look like this:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/album/59
```

Submitting the above request would return the following response:

```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "album",
   "_id": "59",
   "_version": 1,
   "found": true,
   "_source": {
      "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
      "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/...-chronicle-vol-1-20120524",
      "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
      "rank": 59,
      "label": "Fantasy",
      "year": 1976,
      "summary": "Between 1968 and early 1972, CCR rolled out 13 Top 40 ... ",
      "imageUrl": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets ... .jpg"
   }
}
```

Much of the response looks similar to what we saw with the original POST.  In addition, there's

* A new _\_source_ field that contains the entire JSON document that we indexed originally.
* A _found_ field indicating whether or not the document requested was
  found.  (As expected in this case, the value is _true_.)

If we were to make a request using an id that _doesn't_ correspond to an existing document:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/album/501
```

We'd receive the following response:

```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "album",
   "_id": "501",
   "found": false
}
```

Making a request against a _type_ that doesn't exist within a given index results in a similar response:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/bar/59
```

Generates:

```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "bar",
   "_id": "59",
   "found": false
}
```

In contrast, making a GET request against a _non-existent index_ will generate an error (404) response:

```
GET /foo/album/59
```

Results in:

```
{
   "error": "IndexMissingException[[foo] missing]",
   "status": 404
}
```

## Getting Via NEST

To retrieve documents from Elasticsearch using NEST, we need to first
define a POCO `Album` class to hold the data returned in the response.
This is the same `Album` class we
[defined and used in the last post](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/06/04/an-index-on-our-progress/#nest)
as part of indexing.  We then need to
[instantiate a NEST client and connect to our Elasticsearch instance](http://www.textualdevelopment.com/2015/05/28/connecting-the-dots/#nest).

Once these preliminaries are taken care of, we can make a `Get<Album>()` request to retrieve a given document:

```cs
IGetResponse<Album> response = client.Get<Album> (i => i
	.Index ("rolling-stone-500")
	.Id (59)
  );
```

The lambda expression passed to the `Get` function represents a
`Func<GetDescriptor<Album>, GetDescriptor<Album>>`, and is very
similar to the lambda expression we used when performing the original
indexing.  It provides details as to the _index_ and _id_ of our
request.  (NEST is able to infer the _type_ to use in the request,
based on the name of our class.)

The response that we get back is of type `IGetResponse<Album>`, and can
be inspected to get top-level response values:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("_index: {0}", response.Index);
Console.WriteLine("_type: {0}", response.Type);
Console.WriteLine("_id: {0}", response.Id);
Console.WriteLine("found: {0}", response.Found);
```

It also contains a `Source` property of type `Album` that corresponds
to the `_source` value in the HTTP GET request:

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", response.Source.Title);
Console.WriteLine("Url: {0}", response.Source.Url);
Console.WriteLine("Artist: {0}", response.Source.Artist);
Console.WriteLine("Rank: {0}", response.Source.Rank);
Console.WriteLine("Label: {0}", response.Source.Label);
Console.WriteLine("Year: {0}", response.Source.Year);
Console.WriteLine("Summary: {0}", response.Source.Summary);
Console.WriteLine("ImageUrl: {0}", response.Source.ImageUrl);
```

The above inspection code generates the following output:

```
_index: rolling-stone-500
_type: album
_id: 59
found: True
