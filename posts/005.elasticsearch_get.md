## Retrieving via GET

To get our document back out of Elasticsearch, we simply make a a `GET` request, similar to our
original `POST`, but including the id of the document we're requesting as the final segment of the
URL:

```json
GET /rolling-stone-500/album/AU23IKBIhgIsIPcT67Z8
```

Submitting the above request would return the following response:


```json
{
   "_index": "rolling-stone-500",
   "_type": "album",
   "_id": "AU23IKBIhgIsIPcT67Z8",
   "_version": 1,
   "found": true,
   "_source": {
      "title": "Chronicle Vol. 1",
      "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/music/ ... /20120524",
      "artist": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
	  ... 
   }
}
```

Much of the response looks similar to what we saw with the original `POST`.  In addition, there's a
new `_source` field that contains the entire JSON document that we indexed originally.
