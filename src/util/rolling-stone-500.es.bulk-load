Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are the pinnacle of the Beatles' eight years as recording artists. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were never more fearless and unified in their pursuit of magic and transcendence."}

In the existential shuffle \"Tumbling Dice,\" the exhausted country beauty \"Torn and Frayed\" and the whiskey-soaked uplift of \"Shine a Light,\" you literally hear the Stones in exile: working at Richards' villa in the South of France, and on the run from media censure, British drug police (Jagger and Richards already knew the view from behind bars) and the country's onerous tax code. Exile is rife with allusions to their outsider status: The album's cover is a collage of freakish American characters, and on \"Sweet Black Angel\" they toast imprisoned activist Angela Davis \u2013 one set of renegades to another. The music rattles like battle but also swings with clear purpose on songs like \"Rocks Off\" and \"All Down the Line.\" As Richards explained, \"The Stones don't have a home anymore \u2013 hence the Exile \u2013 but they can still keep it together. Whatever people throw at us, we can still duck, improvise, overcome.\" Great example: Richards recorded his jubilant romp \"Happy\" with just producer Jimmy Miller on drums and saxman Bobby Keys \u2013 while waiting for the other Stones to turn up for work. Exile on Main Street is the Stones at their fighting best, armed with the blues, playing to win."}

Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Seventies studio madman Guy Stevens, the Clash's third album skids from bleak punk (\"London Calling\") to rampaging ska (\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\") and disco resignation (\"Lost in the Supermarket\"). The album was made in dire straits too. The band was heavily in debt and openly at war with its record company. Singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones wrote together in Jones' grandmother's flat. \"Joe, once he learned how to type, would bang the lyrics out,\" Jones said. \"Then I'd be able to bang out some music while he was hitting the typewriter.\" Strummer, Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon spent nearly three months rehearsing and demoing songs in a garage in the Pimlico section of London \u2013 \"with one light and filthy carpet on the walls for soundproofing,\" recalled Strummer in 1989. \"We felt that we were struggling,\" he said, \"about to slide down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails.\" But Stevens was on hand for inspiration. He threw chairs around the room \"if he thought a track needed zapping up,\" according to Strummer. The album ends with \"Train in Vain,\" a rousing song of fidelity (unlisted on the back cover because it was added at the last minute) that became the sound of triumph: the Clash's first Top 30 single in the U.S."}

Yet the creative tension resulted in one of the most intense and adventurous rock albums ever made. Lennon pursued his hard-edged vision into the cynical wit of \"Sexy Sadie\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\" but also infused \"Julia\" and \"Dear Prudence\" with childlike yearning. Paul McCartney's playful pop energy came through on his inversion of Chuck Berry's American values, \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" and he showed off his raucous side in \"Helter Skelter.\" Harrison's spiritual yearning led him to \"Long, Long, Long\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" featuring a guest guitar solo from Eric Clapton. Even Starr contributed his first original, the country-tinged \"Don't Pass Me By.\" \"I think it was a very good album,\" said McCartney. \"It stood up, but it wasn't a pleasant one to make.\""}

Elvis Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black were horsing around with \"That's All Right, Mama,\" a tune by bluesman Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, when producer Sam Phillips stopped them and asked, \"What are you doing?\" \"We don't know,\" they said. Phillips told them to \"back up and do it again.\" The A side of Presley's first single (backed with a version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\"), \"That's All Right\" was issued by Sun on July 19th. It may or may not be the first rock & roll record. But the man who would be King was officially on wax. Bridging black and white, country and blues, his sound was playful and revolutionary, charged by a spontaneity and freedom that changed the world. \"It's the blues,\" critic Greil Marcus wrote in his classic book Mystery Train. \"But free of all worry, all sin; a simple joy with no price to pay.\" Presley released four more singles on Sun \u2013 including definitive reinventions of Wynonie Harris' \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" and Junior Parker's \"Mystery Train\" \u2013 before moving on to immortality when Phillips sold his contract to RCA for $35,000. Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley's Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP \u2013 which has since been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King's beginnings at Sun. It collects everything he cut at the studio, including alternate takes and the 1953 acetate he recorded as a gift for his mother as a shy and awkward recent high school graduate."}

But at the time it was made, Kind of Blue was a revolution all its own, a radical break from everything going on. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation \u2013 breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band \u2013 bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley \u2013 soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by \"melodic rather than harmonic variation,\" as Davis put it. Two numbers, \"All Blues\" and \"Freddie Freeloader\" (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis' approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom. Evans wrote in his original liner notes, \"Miles conceived these settings only hours before the re\u00adcording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.\" Or as the late critic Robert Palmer wrote, \"Kind of Blue is, in a sense, all melody \u2013 and atmosphere.\" The bass line in \"So What\" is now among the most familiar obbligatos in jazz, and there is no finer evocation of the late-night wonder of jazz than the muted horns in \"All Blues.\""}

It was no idle boast. Much of what we take for granted in rock would not exist without this New York band or its seminal debut: the androgynous sexuality of glitter; punk's raw noir; the blackened-riff howl of grunge and noise rock; goth's imperious gloom. Recorded dirt-cheap at a studio that was literally falling apart, it is a record of fearless breadth and lyric depth. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed documented carnal desire and drug addiction, decadence and redemption, with a pop wisdom he learned as a song-factory composer for Pickwick Records. Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work with minimalist composer La Monte Young); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed's songs. Rejected as nihilistic by the love crowd in '67, the Banana Album (so named for its Warhol-designed cover) is the most pro\u00adphetic rock album ever made."}

That January, the Beatles were on the verge of a breakup, exhausted and angry with one another after the disastrous sessions for the aborted Get Back LP, later salvaged as Let It Be [see No. 392]. Determined to go out with a sense of recaptured glory, the group reconvened at EMI's Abbey Road Studios to make its most polished album: a collection of superb songs cut with an attention to refined detail, then segued together (especially on Side Two) with conceptual force. There was no thematic link, other than the Beatles' unique genius. John Lennon veered from the stormy metal of \"I\u2008Want You (She's So Heavy)\" to the exquisite vocal sunrise of \"Because.\" Paul McCartney was saucy (\"Oh! Darling\"), silly (\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\") and deliciously bitter (\"You Never Give Me Your Money\"). George Harrison proved his long-secret worth as a composer with \"Something\"\u2008and the folk-pop diamond \"Here Comes the Sun,\" written in his friend Eric Clapton's garden while playing hooky from a business meeting. And Lennon, McCartney and Harrison reputedly sang more three-part harmony here than on any other Beatles album. Let It Be was the group's final release, but this album was its real goodbye."}

In fact, he wrote all of these lyrically piercing, gingerly majestic songs in two months, in mid-1974. He was so proud of them that he privately auditioned almost all of the album, from start to finish, for pals and peers including Mike Bloomfield, David Crosby and Graham Nash before cutting them in September \u2013 in just a week, with members of the bluegrass band Deliverance. But in December, Dylan played the record for his brother David in Minneapolis, who suggested recutting some songs with local musicians. The final Blood was a mix of the slow, pensive New York sessions and the faster, wilder Minneapolis dates. Together, they frame the gritty anguish in some of Dylan's most passionate, confessional songs \u2013 from adult breakup ballads like \"If You See Her, Say Hello\" to the sharp-tongued opprobrium of \"Idiot Wind,\" his greatest put-down song since \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" \"It's hard for me to relate to people enjoying that type of pain,\" Dylan said after the album became an instant success.

No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation \u2013 a nation of teens suddenly turned punk \u2013 and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of fame led already troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994.

Lyrically, Cobain raged in code \u2013 shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing.

The crowning touch was the superior jazz quintet convened by producer Lewis Merenstein to color the mists and shadows. Bassist Richard Davis later said that Morrison never told the musicians what he wanted from them or what the lyrics meant. Maybe he didn't know how to.

On Thriller, the pair heighten the sheen (\"The Girl Is Mine\"), pump up the theater (\"Thriller\") and deepen the funk.

But Franklin channeled that frenzy into performances of funky pride and magisterial hurt. Among the best: the grand-prayer treatment of Curtis Mayfield's \"People Get Ready,\" the revved-up longing of \"Since You've Been Gone (Sweet Sweet Baby)\" and her explosive anguish on the hit cover of Don Covay's \"Chain of Fools.\""}
